= FhatOS: A Distributed Operating System for Embedded Systems (v{revnumber})

image:fhatos-logo.png[width=120,float=left] **FhatOS** (pronounced _fat_) is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_operating_system[distributed operating system] for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266[ESP8266] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32[ESP32] processors with support for sandboxed deployments on Linux and MacOSX systems.
All FhatOS resources, from individual datum, complex structures, files, and processes exist within a single https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier[URI] address space called **furi** (pronounced "fury" or "fhat URI").
Processes communicate via a publish-subscribe message passing protocol that rides atop the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT[MQTT] pubsub protocol while supporting various levels of access from thread local, to machine local and ultimately, globally via cluster remote.

== FhatOS Architecture

FhatOS is organized along a design principle that undersands computing as being composed of 3 fundamental phenomena: **process** (time), **structure** (space), and **language** (perspective). The core FhatOS kernel (typically denoted `/sys/`) can be divided along these lines as exemplified by the following resources:

. `/sys/scheduler/` (**process**): provides all thread, fiber, and coroutine processes compute time on the underlying hardware processor.
. `/sys/router/` (**structure**) : maintains the multi-level tuple space used for storing and retrieving resources in the fURI address space.
. `/sys/mmadt/` (**language**): exposes parsing, type management, and caching functionality to all mm-ADT progams.

All resources off the specified kernel fURIs can be interacted with, but can not be shutdown. That is, `Ø\->/sys/#` yields an error. Without these resources, FhatOS will not function propertly.

User resources are typicaly structured as below:

. `/io/`: location of input/output devices such as terminal, files, etc.
. `/home/`: location of all user data and programs.
. `/driver/`: location of all external device drivers.
. `/log/`: location of all log output.
. `/ext/`: location of various mm-ADT extensions.

The following subsections will provide a short overview of the aforementioned resources in reverse order: mm-ADT, router, and then scheduler.

=== The mm-ADT Language

FhatOS software can be written in C/C\++ or mm-ADT (**multi-model abstract data type**). mm-ADT is a cluster-oriented programming language and virtual machine founded on 5 **mono-types** (`bool`, `int`, `real`, `uri`, and `str`) and 2 **poly-types** (**lst** and **rec**), where `rec` is a `lst` of 2-`obj` `lsts` with particular semantics regarding key uniqueness. mm-ADT programs are sent via message to the FhatOS scheduler and then spawned as a process accordingly.
FhatOS provides a collection of device drivers and new device drivers can be written (typically in C/C++).
Provided drivers include pulse wave modulation, thermometer, gas, H-bridge, etc. sensors and actuators.

A simple mm-ADT program is defined below.
The program is a specialization of the poly-type `rec` called `thread`, where `thread` is abstractly defined as

The `thread` object is published to the fURI endpoint `esp32@127.0.0.1/scheduler/threads/logger`.
The scheduler spawns the program on an individual `thread` accessible via the target fURI.
Once spawned, the `setup` function prints the thread's id and halts.

fhatos> thread[[setup => print('setup complete'),
                loop  => stop(/abc/)]].to(/abc/)

=== A FhatOS Console

.FhatOS Console
****
The FhatOS Console is a composite of 3 other actors:

. The `Terminal` (`/sys/io/terminal/`) provides thread-safe access to hardware I/O.
. The `Parser` (`/sys/lang/parser/`) converts string input to bytecode output.
. The `Processor` (`/sys/lang/processor/`) executes bytecode.
****

    processor =[objs]=> ~/abc
      <=[objs]= console

### fURI and MQTT

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT[MQTT] is a publish/subscribe message passing protocol that has found extensive usage in embedded systems.
Hierarchically specified _topics_ can be **subscribed** and **published** to.
In MQTT, there is no direct communication between actors, though such behavior can be simulated if an actor's mailbox is a unique topic.
FhatOS leverages MQTT, but from the vantage point of URIs instead of topics with message routing being location-aware.
There exist three MQTT routers:

. `MonadRouter`: An MQTT router scoped to an active monad (**thread**) processing a monoid (**program**).
. `MonoidRouter`: An MQTT router scoped to a monoid (**program**).
. `HostRouter`: An MQTT router scoped to the current host (**machine**).
. `ClusterRouter`: An MQTT router scoped to the current intranet (**cluster**).
. `GlobalRouter` : An MQTT router scoped to the Internet.
. `MetaRouter`: An MQTT router dynamically scoped to other routers based on fURI endpoints.

.fURI Router Scope Patterns
****
TIP: The more `/` in the fURI prefix, the more distributed the fURI space.

* `abc` monad scoped fURI.
* `~/abc` monoid scoped fURI ("home directory" of executing program).
* `/abc` host scoped fURI (rooted at `localhost`).
* `//abc` cluster scoped fURI (hosted on the intranet).
* `//fhatos.org/abc` globally scoped fURI (hosted on the internet)
