== FhatOS Boot Loader

To boot [fhatos], the environmental variable `FHATOS_HOME` must be set to the root directory of the distribution and `$FHATOS_HOME/bin` must be added to the shell environment's `PATH` variable. This is required for all boot processes as well as development processes afforded by `bin/fhat-dev`. See `fhatos --help` for more information.

[source,bash]
----
$ fhatos --help
FhAtoS: A Distributed Operating System
  --help           = noobj
  --boot:config    = uri?local_dir_path
  --ansi           = bool?colorize
  --log            = uri?{INFO,WARN,ERROR,DEBUG,TRACE,ALL,NONE}
  --fs:mount       = uri?local_dir_path
  --mqtt:broker    = uri?server uri
  --mqtt:client    = uri?client_name
  --console:nest   = int?depth
  --console:prompt = str?prompt_string
  --lib            = uri?{module,...}

=== Booting on Linux/Unix/Mac

To boot on Linux, `fhatos` is executed.

[source,bash]
----
$ fhatos --boot:config=/boot/boot_config.obj
----

====
TIP: The default boot configuration is located at `${FHATOS_HOME}/data/boot/boot_config.obj`}.
If this is the desired boot configuration, then calling `fhatos` with no arguments is sufficient.

image:cooties.png[width=140,float=left,title=cooties] [yellow]*f*​[red]*h*​[fuchsia]#a#​[aqua]#t#​[blue]*O*​[lime]*S*​ is designed according to the philosophy that computing is composed of 3 fundamental, interacting phenomena:
[.h]#structure# (space), [.h]#process# (time), and [h.]#language# (perspective).
As such,the [yellow]*f*​[lime]#H#​[blue]*a*​[fuchsia]#t#​[red]*O*​[aqua]*S*​ kernel is comprised of the followng resources:

. `/sys/scheduler` (**process**): coordinates all processes realized as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)[threads], fibers, and coroutines.
. `/sys/router` (**structure**) : manages all structures comprising a distributed, partitioned, read/write https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple_space[tuple space].
. `/mmadt/` (**language**): provides https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar[parsing], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system[type reasoning], and execution of mmADT programs.

These resources are accessible via their respective fURIs.
The fURI space is a subset of the common URI space, and is the address space through which all resources within [lime]*f*​[aqua]*h*​[fuchsia]#a#​[red]#t#​[blue]#o#​[yellow]#s#​ communicate.
A fURI is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)[dereferenced] using the mmADT `from` instruction (sugar'd `*`).
Dereferencing returns the resources pointed to by the fURI.
In mmADT, these resources are called `obj` (objects).

IMPORTANT: The `[cpp]` representation of an `inst` value means that the instruction's implementation is written C++.
As such, no further introspection is possible from within mmADT.
When the instruction implementation is written in mmADT, the instruction value is displayed as `bcode` (a linear chain of `objs`).
